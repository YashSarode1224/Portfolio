# My Developer Portfolio

Hi! This is my personal website where I show off my coding projects. It has a "Gamer/Hacker" theme with cool 3D effects.

### What is this?
It's a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features:
* A moving "Matrix" style background.
* A fake terminal window you can type commands into.
* A list of my projects and contact info.
